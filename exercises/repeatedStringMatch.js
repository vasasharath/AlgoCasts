Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. 
If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it;
 and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").

Note:
The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.

var repeatedStringMatch = function(A, B) {
     let i = 0;
    let str = '';
    //iterate through the string
    while (str.length <= B.length) {
         str = A.repeat(++i);
        if (str.indexOf(B) !== -1){
            return i;
        }
    }
    
    if (A.repeat(++i).indexOf(B) !== -1){
        return i;
    }
    return -1;
};
